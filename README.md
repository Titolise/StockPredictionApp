<h1 align="center">Stock Trend Prediction App ðŸ“ˆ</h1>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is a Data Science project that involves using machine learning to analyse financial databases that have been downloaded from Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>Then I modelled a simple LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras to build a simple machine learning model to predict stock prices.</p>
<p>Finally, I used Streamlit to create a responsive web interface that would allow users to enter the source data to start the analysis and the ticker of the stock to be analysed.</p>

<p>Thanks for watching! ðŸ˜Š</p>
